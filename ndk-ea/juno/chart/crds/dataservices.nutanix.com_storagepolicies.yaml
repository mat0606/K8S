        description: StoragePolicy is the Schema for the storagepolicies API A StoragePolicy
          defines a set of capabilities supported by the storage system which will
          be exposed as StorageClass. The corresponding StorageClass in turn can be
          used by applications to provision volumes with the desired SLA. The creator
          of this API resource should be unaware of which storage constructs like
          storage containers are created on behalf of the policy.
